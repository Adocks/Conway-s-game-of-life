Hi, I'm a french Engineer student that love to code things on my own.
I noticed that the few python program around conway's game where a bit over complicated, therefore I decided to create my own.
I'm aware that this code is pointless comparing to the level of some programmers on the net, I just wanted to share this and get feedback in order to learn from other people perspectivs.
Feel free to complete this game in order to make it more efficient, gui friendly or whatever.
Thanks
